    <p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is a man from Springfield and the protagonist of the animated television series The Simpsons.
        He is a crude, ignorant, and slobbish individual, although he is fundamentally a good person and shows great caring and loyalty to his family, friends and on occasion, to those he barely knows or those he considers his enemies.</p>
